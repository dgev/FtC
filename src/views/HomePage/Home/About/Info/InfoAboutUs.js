        <h4 className={classes.hFour}>Mane Grigoryan</h4>
        <p>
          Mane and her buddy truly belong to the Upper East Side. Very much like Alex, Mane’s future
          was set from the moment she was born, since she was doomed to become one of the awesomest
          people in the entire universe. “Silver spoon syndrome” squared. Having been born into this
          life, she didn't really have to prove herself to others, because her strictest judge was,
          is and always will be her solemn self. And very much like Alex, she doesn’t refer to her
          work as “JOB” because she gets the utmost pleasure from doing what she loves and loving
          what she does. When their worlds are in order, both Mane and Alex are warm and likable,
          friendly and the heart and soul of any and every place they appear. Their shining and
          quite charming personality is impossible not to fall for. They definitely enjoy not only
          people of their type, but also personalities that diverge from their own They both like to
          be able to see the air that they breathe, so the city life is what they are aiming for not
          only for vacationing, but spending their lives in general. Intelligent and educated, they
          both need a bit more time for greater commitments and changes, but the decisions they
          commit to are always executed and performed in the best way possible. Like any unique and
          great creature of that calibre, they both are a ham. They like surprises but mostly the
          ones that are organized by them, because not everyone tries to focus on small personal
          details as much as them. They both like when their hair looks good and it sure does every
          single time. Alex and Mane are defined by their environment and demand that the world
          around them reflects their views of themselves. Food must be cooked to exact
          specifications. Things around them must be ordered and scheduled, also “dirt-free”. They
          like having a general plan for the day, but years of experience made it a piece of cake
          for them to act under pressure and create a solid and working plan from a scratch in just
          bare seconds.

        <h4 className={classes.hFour}>Nona Baytalyan</h4>
        <p>
          Melman and Nona share many characteristic traits and interests.One of the most obvious
          ones is the literal obsession in the medical sphere despite the fact that none of them
          actually owns any degree in that field. Having so many doctors around from the very young
          childhood till now, fear of doctors is considered irrational and even imaginary for both
          of them. They both are nice, but most importantly are extremely loyal to their friends and
          family. Sometimes they may doubt themselves, but that doesn’t stop them from moving
          towards their destination. Melman, very much like Nona, are a bit more sceptical about
          themselves, and while being very supportive, understanding and positive towards others,
          their self-criticism helps them determine themselves as pessimistic realists. However,
          while Melman loves to consume doses of medicine for meals, Nona enjoys consuming fruits
          more. They both are always up for a good and cosy conversation and are open-minded,
          however that doesn’t mean that they give up on their own views and ideas easily. They
          dream a lot and strongly believe that every dream has a very high probability to become a
          reality. Nona, as well as Melman, love to explore new things, places and share those
          feelings and emotions with the people that matter.

        <h4 className={classes.hFour}>Diana Gevorgyan</h4>
        <p>
          The biggest similarity that Diana and Marty share is that everybody loves to be around
          both these incredible characters. Marty took up Diana’s incredible talent of making
          friends easily because they both have a way of making others feel good about themselves
          and they both truly appreciate the nature of every character in their lives. These two are
          idealists and optimists. Both Marty and Diana always see that the glass is half full.
          Their great personality is comfortable with trying new and exciting things, because they
          don’t only learn and adapt very fast, but also can see opportunities and positivity
          everywhere. The grass is always greener, but on the contrary to the common belief, not
          only on the other side. The grass is greener, if the people around them are happy. Helping
          everyone around them, they are hardly satisfied with themselves because their
          perfectionist souls demand that the show must go on. Diana and Marty easily adapt to the
          changes and can find solutions for literally any crisis situation they encounter. They
          love to dream, and those dreams are colorful and detailed and great, and they do their
          best for those dreams to come true. And you know what, the great thing about those dreams
          is that they actually become reality, because hard work and commitment pay off. Even
          though Marty is a New Yorker, while Diana is from Yerevan, smartness genes run in their
          blood. They share a great combination of wit and empathy. They both can and are great at
          whatever they put their minds to. The only thing that they really crave for is a healthy,
          open and honest environment, because that is the environment they grow and prosper.

        <h4 className={classes.hFour}>Mane Baluyan</h4>
        <p>
          If you think of a hip, empowered, independent, and cosmopolitan woman who knows what,
          when, where she wants and knows exactly how to get it, then hello, you reached Mane and
          Gloria. They are strikingly beautiful, but that is not the only card in their sleeve. In
          fact they have an entire deck they easily shuffle. They have so much to offer, and are not
          scared to share their ideas, ambitions, thoughts and experience with others, because you
          can steal from them and try to be like them, but the truth has to be spoken, you can never
          be them. The great sense of humor runs in their blood. Mane and Gloria have made their
          lives what they are all on their own. Knowing how to take care of themselves in the big
          city or a small village, is a talent they can claim full credits for. Mane and Gloria have
          a strong sense of who they are, but also a stronger sense of what they want. Even though
          they can be the happiest on their own, they willingly choose to share all that with their
          family and friends. If they are friends with you, that friendship will most probably last
          for a lifetime or even longer, the only key here is to be as committed, honest and loyal
          as these two ladies. They accept people around them just the way they are, without trying
          to build sand castles and illusions around.
